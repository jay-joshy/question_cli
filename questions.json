    "question": "A 43-year-old woman reports a 3-month history of rash and difficulty walking. She has a 2-year history of asthma that has worsened during the past 6 months. She is taking a high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid and a long-acting beta agonist but continues to have coughing at night, chest tightness while walking, and only partial relief with the use of a short-acting beta agonist. On examination, there is weakness of ankle dorsiflexion bilaterally, severe on the right and mild on the left. She has scattered palpable purpuric skin lesions on both legs. Her total leukocyte count is 17,000 per mm3 (reference range, 4500-11,000); the leukocyte differential includes 35% eosinophils. Which one of the following tests is most likely to be diagnostic in this case?",

    "question": "A previously healthy 25-year-old woman reports frequent infections during the past 3 years, including several sinus infections and two episodes of pneumonia. A purified protein derivative test, sputum testing for acid-fast bacilli, and HIV serology testing are all negative. A chest radiograph is within normal limits. Other laboratory testing reveals a normal leukocyte count, and flow cytometry documents normal B-cell and T-cell counts. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and A levels are low; IgM and IgE levels are normal.

    "question": "A 32-year-old man with long-standing, persistent asthma reports worsening wheezing, cough, and dyspnea during the past month. He has been using high-dose combination inhaled glucocorticoid-long-acting beta,-agonist treatment and inhaled albuterol every 4 hours. Three weeks ago, he started montelukast and oral prednisone 40 mg daily. Laboratory evaluation reveals an immunoglobulin E level of 2410 1U/mL (reference range, 10-179) and a positive skin test to Aspergillus fumigatus. His leukocyte count before starting treatment with oral glucocorticoids was 9200 per mm3 (reference range, 4500-11,000) with 12% eosinophils (0-8). CT of the chest shows central bronchiectasis.
